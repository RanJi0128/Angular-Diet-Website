        "Anecdotal reports and scientific studies alike find that guys who take creatine gain a good 10 pounds or more of bodyweight and increase strength dramatically. " +
        "Creatine works in a number of ways. For one, it increases the amount of fast energy in your muscles needed to perform reps in the gym. " +
        "The more of this fast energy that's available, the more reps you can do with a given weight, allowing you to get bigger and stronger in the long run. " +
        "Creatine also draws more water into your muscle cells, placing a stretch on the cell that increases long-term growth. " +
        "Most recently, creatine has been found to increase levels of insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in muscles, which is critical for stimulating growth.";

But your carnosine supply is limited to the pool of its root enzymes, amino acids l-histidine and beta-alanine. That means supplementing with beta-alanine helps replenish your stores of carnosine." +
        " In fact, a 2010 study in Nutrients found that taking 800 mg of the amino acid multiple times a day elevated muscle carnosine levels by as much as 66%. Why it’s worth it: Brazilian research found that taking beta-alanine supplements can help your muscles’ endurance and specifically your performance during high intensity exercises like weight " +

        "Exercise Metabolism found that guys who took a combination of both creatine and beta-alanine gained more lean mass and lost more body fat than guys who took creatine alone. Since it has a limited half-life in the body, most research suggests taking 800 mgs of beta-alanine at least four times a day.";
